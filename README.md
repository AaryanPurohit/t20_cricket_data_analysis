# 🏏 Cricket Team Analyzer: T20 World Cup 2022  
**Project Sportan**  
*"Selecting the Best 11 Players on the Planet"*  

---

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project identifies the **optimal T20 World Cup 2022 squad** by analyzing player performance against role-specific parameters. The goal is to build a team that:  
- **Scores 180+ runs** on average.  
- **Defends 150 runs** on average.  

Players are evaluated across five roles: **Openers**, **Middle Order**, **Finishers**, **All-Rounders**, and **Specialist Fast Bowlers**, using metrics like batting average, strike rate, and bowling economy.  

---

## ⭐ Features   
- **Interactive Power BI Dashboard**: Explore players using dynamic filters and visualizations like scatter plots, heatmaps, and radar charts.  
- **Role-Specific Player Evaluation**: Assess players for 5 roles with predefined parameters:  
  - **Openers**: Batting Avg >30, Strike Rate >140, Boundary % >50  
  - **Middle Order**: Batting Avg >40, Strike Rate >125, Avg. Balls Faced >20  
  - **Finishers**: Batting Avg >25, Strike Rate >130, Batting Position >4  
  - **All-Rounders**: Batting Avg >15, Strike Rate >140, Bowling Economy <7  
  - **Specialist Fast Bowlers**: Economy ≤7, Dot Ball % >40, Innings Bowled >4  
- **Real-Time Projections**: Instantly calculates team's projected average score (180+ runs) and defense capability (150 runs).  
- **Drag-and-Drop Team Builder**: Visually assemble your final 11 by selecting top performers from each role.

## 🚀 Steps to Build the Project  

### 1. **Data Collection**  
- **Web Scraping**:  
  - Collected raw T20 data (batting, bowling, match results) from **ESPN Cricinfo** using Python libraries:  
    - `Beautiful Soup` for parsing HTML.  
    - `Scrapy` for structured data extraction.  
  - Stored scraped data in **JSON format** for initial processing.  

### 2. **Data Preprocessing**  
- **Cleaning & Structuring**:  
  - Converted JSON files to structured **CSV datasets** using `pandas` and `numpy`.  
  - Removed irrelevant columns, fixed formatting errors, and standardized player/match IDs.  
  - Processed three key datasets:  
    - `Batting Summary` (runs, strike rate, boundaries).  
    - `Bowling Summary` (economy, wickets, dot balls).  
    - `Match Results` (team scores, venues, dates).  
  - Linked files using SQL for consistency (e.g., joining player IDs across tables).  

- **Filtering & Aggregation**:  
  - Applied **SQL queries** to filter players with sufficient innings (e.g., `SELECT * FROM players WHERE innings > 5`).  
  - Aggregated metrics like average runs, strike rate, and economy.  
  - Final output: Cleaned CSV files ready for analysis.  

### 3. **Dashboard Development**  
- **Power BI Setup**:  
  - Loaded CSV files into **Power BI** and refined data using **Power Query**:  
    - Added calculated columns (e.g., `Boundary %`, `Dot Ball %`).  
    - Merged tables for cross-metric analysis.  
  - **DAX Implementation**:  
    - Created metrics like `Batting Avg`, `Bowling Strike Rate`, and `Player Selection` flags.  
    - Example:  
      ```dax  
      Batting Avg = DIVIDE([Total Runs], [Total Innings Dismissed], 0)  
      ```  
  - **Visualizations**:  
    - Built interactive charts (bar, scatter), matrices, and heatmaps.  
    - Designed role-specific tabs for Openers, Middle Order, etc.  

### 4. **Team Selection**  
- **Role-Specific Shortlisting**:  
  - Applied criteria from `Parameter Scoping.pdf` (e.g., Openers: `Strike Rate > 140`).  
  - Filtered top performers using Power BI slicers and SQL-backed metrics.  
- **Team Builder Panel**:  
  - Assembled the final 11 using a drag-and-drop interface.  
  - Validated team balance against goals:  
    - Projected **180+ average score**.  
    - Ability to defend **150 runs**.
